**Talikasih** is a place to donate and raise funds online. We believe that technological advances should be used to connect the spirit of kindness and mutual cooperation. In **Talikasih**, people can raise funds for various things they are fighting for or donate for things they want to help. **Talikasih** believes sharing is easy and fun. We make innovations to make it easier for fundraisers and donors to share kindness.
